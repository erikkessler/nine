This directory contains the source for the sokoban puzzle.
A curses-based implementation by Duane Bailey (c) 2010-14.

It may be built by typing:
   make sokoban

You will see that this compiles and links sokoban.c with win.c.  Your job
is to implement the win-checking procedure, win.  This is documented in the
lab sheet, found in sokoban.pdf (on unix, you can gv sokoban.pdf).

The screens directory contains all the files necessary to play the game:
  * there are 91 levels of play (screen.0-screen.90)
  * there is an emacs work facade screen (WORK)
  * there is a screen of help (HELP)
Any of these may be edited as you see fit.

To run sokoban, simply type:
  sokoban
To run it on a particular level (say 10), type:
  sokoban 10
There is a zero-level, for quick testing.  The program starts, by default, 
at level 1.

Most of these levels are quite hard.  You can find best-play records on the
web.

EDITS:
The system keeps track of the player's biometric indicators.  You may wish
to enter your birthday in win.c on the line:
   int BDay[] = { <month>, <day>, <year> };

Enjoy!
 Duane
