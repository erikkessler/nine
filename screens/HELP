                             THE SOKOBAN PUZZLE
                            by Hiroyuki Imabayashi

Sokoban (``warehouse keeper'') is a puzzle where a worker (@) pushes
boxes ($) into storage locations (.).  When all boxes have been stored
away, the puzzle is solved.

The warehouse keeper is only able to shove one box at a time, and boxes
may not be pulled.  Because of this, it is possible that a box has been
irretrievably shoved into a corner before it makes it to its storage
location.  The puzzle is lost, and must be undone before play continues.

The challenge is to solve the puzzle in the fewest moves possible.

Symbols: @ = worker    $ = box    . = storage area    # = wall
         * = worker in storage area    * = box in storage area

Keys: ^N  Move worker up one line       ^P  Move worker down one line
      ^B  Move worker left one space    ^F  Move worker right one space
      ^_  Backup one move (undo)        ^U  Repeat next command 4 times
      SPACE Put up emacs facade         ?   Get help
                         ^G  Give up playing sokoban
                      (Press any key to return to play.)
